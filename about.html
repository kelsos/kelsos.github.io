## About

I am passionate about software development. I always love to create and learn new things.
I have been working professionally on Android and web, and blockchain related projects, but
I have also spend some experience with C# and the .NET Framework.

I am currently located in Berlin, Germany.

I am interested in software design and I always try to improve my skills,
in order to build robust applications and services.

I love Open Source software and linux, my favorite distribution is Arch Linux which I use as my primary operating system.
