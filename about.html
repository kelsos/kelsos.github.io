## About

I am passionate about software development. I always love to create and learn new things.
I have been working professionally mostly on Android and front-end web technologies, but
I have also spend some time working with C# and the .NET.

I am currently located in Berlin, Germany and I am employed by brainbot technologies AG.

I am interested in software design and I always try to improve my skills,
in order to build robust applications and services.
I am fascinated by blockchain technologies and I try to learn more about on my free time.
I love Open Source software and linux, my favorite distribution is Arch Linux which I use as my primary operating system.
