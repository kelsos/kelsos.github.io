The previous site was intended as a temporary solution, while I was working on the new one.
Unfortunately due to work and life obligations the temporary solution of 2013 was rather long lived.

So after a really long period of time it is finally time for an update.

The new site is created using Jekyll and the [Jekyll Personal Theme](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme 'Jekyll Personal Theme').

There is also an update planed for the [MusicBee Remote website](https://mbrc.kelsos.net 'MusicBee Remote - official site')
but this will happen after the update of the application and the creation of the new help guide.

Regards Kelsos.
