The previous jekyll template was quite outdated, and it has not been properly updated for a long time,
so I decided to modernize it a bit.

Since I am mostly working with Vue lately I decided to build the updated site using a combination of [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com),
[NuxtLabs UI](https://ui.nuxtlabs.com) along with the [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org) plugin,
and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Most of the site should be as it was before, but I decided to remove disqus as a comment mechanism.

Regards Kelsos.
