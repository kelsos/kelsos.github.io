The previous site was intended as a temporary solution, while I was working on the new one.
Unfortunately due to work and life obligations the temporary solution of 2013 was rather long lived.

So after a really long period of time it is finally time for an update.
 
The new site is created using Jekyll and the <a href="https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme">Jekyll Personal Theme</a>.
 
There is also an update planed for the <a href="http://kelsos.net/">MusicBee Remote website</a> but this will happen after the update 
of the application and the creation of the new help guide.

Regards Kelsos.
